    <p>
        const numberEx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
//Task-  Create an array of numbers then create a .map() to create a new array that contains square numbers.

const square= function(x){
    numbersEx.forEach(){
        return numbersEx
    }
}

<p>The issue i had here was  that i used .forEach vs .map. I learned
    that forEach iterates through the array but it does not make a new one. .map does so.
    *The explanation below



    ---Key Points to Note
    Use .map() Instead of .forEach():
    
    .map() is designed to create a new array with the transformed elements, while .forEach() is primarily for performing an action on each element without creating a new array.
    Accessing the Array:
    
    There’s a small typo: numberEx is your array, but in your function, you’re referring to it as numbersEx. This will cause an error because numbersEx isn’t defined.
</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
    <p>using .map()</p>
    <p>const numberEx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

        // Task: Create an array that contains the squares of each number
        const squares = numberEx.map(function(x) {
            return x * x;
        });
        
        console.log(squares); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
        </p>
    </p>

    <h5>Understanding the formula</h5>
    <h7>Explanation of each part</h7>

    <p>1. Define the Array</p>
    <p>const numberEx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
        Here, numberEx is an array of numbers from 1 to 10. The goal is to create a new array where each element is the square of the corresponding element in numberEx.

    </p>
    
    <p>Using .map():</p>
    <p>
        const squares = numberEx.map(function(x) {
            return x * x;
        });
    
        Let’s break down what’s happening in this line.

        .map(): This array method goes through each element in numberEx, applies a specified function to each element, and returns a new array with the transformed values. It doesn’t modify the original array.
        
        The Callback Function: Inside .map(), we pass a function (called a "callback") that takes an element x from numberEx, performs an operation on it, and returns a new value.
        
        return x * x: This line takes each number in the original array, squares it, and returns that result to be stored in the new array squares
        </p>
    
    <p>3. Output
        console.log(squares); // Expected output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

       <p>The console.log() statement prints out the new array squares, which contains the squares of each number from the original array numberEx.</p> 


       Why .map() Works Here
       
The .map() method is ideal here because:

It automatically iterates over each element in the array.
It returns a new array without changing the original array.
It applies the transformation you define in the callback function—in this case, squaring each number.
Visualizing the Process
Think of .map() as follows:

It starts at the first element in numberEx (1), squares it (1 * 1 = 1), and puts 1 in the new array.
It moves to the second element (2), squares it (2 * 2 = 4), and adds 4 to the new array.
This continues until it reaches the last element (10), squares it (10 * 10 = 100), and adds 100 to the new array.
At the end, squares contains [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
