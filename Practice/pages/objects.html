    <h1>Objects</h1>

    <h3>What is an Object in Javascript?</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, objects are collections of related 
        data and functionality, made up of key-value pairs. 
        Think of them like real-world objects where each property 
        represents a characteristic of that object.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Keys: name, age, isStudent</li>
            <li>Values: "Alice", 25, true</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Heres an example!


            const person = {
                name: "Alice",
                age: 25,
                isStudent: true
            };
            
        </p>
